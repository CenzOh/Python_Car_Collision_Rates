# Python_Car_Collision_Rates
Python project that looks into car collision data.

The objective of my project is to understand the correlation between vehicle collisions and why they occur. Searching for patterns is key, which I can locate using the data set, Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes, Motor Vehicle Collisions – Person, DOT Street Lights and Traffic Signals on NYC OpenData and New York Weather from Meteoblue archive. By studying vehicle collision patterns, I am hoping to establish a way to forecast and understand the dynamics that result in a vehicle collision.
