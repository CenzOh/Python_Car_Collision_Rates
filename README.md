# Python_Car_Collision_Rates
Python project that looks into car collision data./
The objective of my project is to understand the correlation between vehicle collisions and why they occur. Searching for patterns is key, which I can locate using the data set, Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes, Motor Vehicle Collisions – Person, DOT Street Lights and Traffic Signals on NYC OpenData and New York Weather from Meteoblue archive. By studying vehicle collision patterns, I am hoping to establish a way to forecast and understand the dynamics that result in a vehicle collision./
